This repository outlines the approaches adopted to solve the challenges in a CTF-format assignment as part of the NUS module CS2107.

## Solve Techniques

The techniques used for the solves are summarised as follows:

E2: XSS (Web)

E3: Web Forensics

E4: Network Forensics

M1: Cookie Exploit (Web)

M2: Buffer Overflow (Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation)

M3: Integer Overflow and Buffer Overflow (Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation)

M4: SQL Injection (Web)
